During the summer of 2015, John Nihi and I conducted research on soil samples to predict how the stability of the slopes from which they were drawn would be affected by saturation during rainfall events. We won a first place prize at the [2015 Indigenous Knowledge in Engineering (IKE) Symposium](http://manoa.hawaii.edu/kaunana/student-engineers-participate-in-native-hawaiian-stem-symposium/).

The Landslide Early Warning System project was sponsored by the State of Hawaii Department of Transportation. The soil samples we analyzed came from areas where landslides might occur along the Pali and Likelike highways. The areas of interest were a natural cut slope and a manmade embankment, respectively.

Our task was to construct experimental and theoretical grain size distribution (GSD) curves for our various soil samples, and to compare these with data collected from instruments at the field sites to determine the effect of soil saturation on slope stability.


- Constructed and compared experimental GSD curves from the
  traditional wet sieve and hydrometer methods vs. laser diffraction

- Concluded that the laser diffraction method approximates GSD with a
  degree of accuracy similar to traditional methods at a lower time cost
