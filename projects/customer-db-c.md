<img class="ui large rounded image" src="../images/customer-db-interface-c.png">

I implemented a mock customer database interface in the C programming language for ICS 212 class, Program Structure. The application has no GUI, but is designed to be used through the command-line interface (CLI). 

Vacay is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
