## Overview

 During the fall of 2016, I and a team of fellow UH Manoa software engineering students built a modern web app. We called it Club Connector, because its purpose was to help UH Manoa students easily sift through UH's 200+ clubs to find the ones that fit them best.

The core features of the app reside in the Browse page, where students can view an array of club results in response to a query by keyword or by type of club. It also allows students to favorite clubs that they are interested in, so that they can remember them later on.

### Responsibilities

The design of the club profile page, which displays the detailed club description and contact information, was my responsibility. I was also responsible for implementing the back-end and front-end functionality of the forms which allow admins to add and edit club information.

To do this, we created both a theoretical and experimental SWCC. In order to create our theoretical curve, we first conducted gradation analysis on all of our soil samples to create grain-size distribution (GSD) curves. We were then able to transform the data into our theoretical SWCC using the Soil Vision software. For our experimental curve, we used Pressure Plate and Vapor Sorption Analyzer (VSA) tests. Finally, we combined the theoretical and experimental curves with water content data from the field. At the time that I left this project, the experimental curve was not yet complete, because it took a long time to run Pressure Plate experiments in the lab. However, the points of the experimental curve that we were able to plot fit the theoretical curve well. Our analysis showed that saturation, and the reduction in suction that accompanies it, had a measurable effect on soil stability in samples from the areas of interest.

### User Study

At the end of our fall 2016 semester, we hand-picked a small group of students to test our app and provide us with feedback for improvement.

We compared the accuracy of each method in specific ranges. The hydrometer method tends to overestimate clay-sized particles, while the laser diffraction method tends to underestimate them. 

We also compared how long it took to perform our experiments with each method. It took us about 4-5 days to completely grade samples using the wet sieve/hydrometer method, and about 10-15 minutes to completely grade samples using the laser diffraction method. 

There are also differences between individual laser diffraction machines, but in our experiments we used only the Horiba LA-950V2.

Through our analysis, we concluded that use of the Horiba LA-950V2 approximates GSD with a degree of accuracy similar to traditional methods at a much lower time cost.
